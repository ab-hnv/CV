<h1 >Come See About Me</h1>
</div>

<p class="poem-body">I was looking at you, looking at me<br>Your eyes had always been my focus<br>I knew it wasn't a phase when I felt what I felt<br>When you held my hand<br>Smiled and rested your head on my shoulders<br><br>The invisible strings<br>That you certainly knew how to pull<br>I gazed wide-eyed<br>As my Cotton scarf with turquoise dye<br>Unravelled line by line<br><br>
   These days, I dont feel alive anymore<br>And to every new passenger have I lied<br>They dont know much about you<br>And now neither do I<br><br>
    Over the years we grew apart but<br>Your number has always been on my favourites' list<br>The 'hello' is still the same<br>Once a month when the phone rings<br>Five years of memory<br>The good, the ugly and the turbulent<br><br>My days, some are good, some not so fine<br>When I wake up from my lonely nightmares<br>Yours is the only name that comes to my mind<br><br>Five years later, Last night You walked up to me<br>and hugged me in my dreams<br>Five years felt like yesterday<br>And now yesterday seems centuries away<br>Maybe you could make some time to come see about me</p>
